//Hello Admin: Make a array of five or more usernames, including the name 'admin'. Imagine you are writing code that will print a greeting to each user after they log in to a website. Loop through the array, and print a greeting to each user:
//• If the username is 'admin', print a special greeting, such as Hello admin, would you like to see a status report?
//• Otherwise, print a generic greeting, such as Hello Eric, thank you for logging in again.



// Make an array of usernames
const usernames: string[] = ["admin", "Akhtar", "Hameed", "Ali", "Ahmed"];

// Loop through the array and print a greeting for each user
for (const username of usernames) {
    if (username.toLowerCase() === "admin") {
        console.log("Hello admin, would you like to see a status report?");
    } else {
        console.log(`Hello ${username}, thank you for logging in again.`);
    }
}
